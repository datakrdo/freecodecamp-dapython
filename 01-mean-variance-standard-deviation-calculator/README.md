# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

## Description
Project #1 of the Data Analysis with Python Certification. Task was to create a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. Full instructions can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).

## Tools used
- NumPy

## Resolution
Jupyter Notebook with my solution can be found [here](mean_var_std_krdo.ipynb).
